# PowerTrip — EV charging route planner

*2026-09-07 · the repo that will grow into the Kotlin Multiplatform app, directory `chargeahead`.*

## Concept

Europe-wide EV route planner. You tell it your car and where you're going; it plans the
charging stops, shows what each stop actually costs across networks and tariffs, and hands
navigation off to Google Maps. The app plans — Google Maps drives.

## Features (MVP)

### 1. Route planning
- Origin / destination / optional waypoints with Google Places autocomplete.
- Vehicle profile: battery capacity, consumption, connector type, starting charge.
  Without this, charging-stop planning is guesswork — it's a hard requirement, not a setting.
  Consumption is a per-car slider seeded with the manufacturer spec — every driver is
  different, and the adjusted value is what the stop planner and range estimate use.
- Google Routes API, traffic-aware (`departure_time=now`), so ETAs and stop timing reflect
  real congestion. Traffic shown per leg on the route. No departure-time preferences in
  the MVP — you leave now, traffic is always live.
- Stop planner picks fast chargers near the route from remaining range, charger power,
  detour cost, and the active filters (see 3).

### 2. Google Maps handoff
Navigation never happens in-app. Three ways to send, all from the route view:

- **Whole route** — dedicated button, always visible. Sends origin + all charging stops +
  destination as one Google Maps directions link.
- **Route section** — a select mode: mark a section of the route by tapping its two
  endpoints (any of origin, stops, destination); the legs in between highlight; a
  contextual button sends just that section.
- **Single stop** — each stop card has a send action that ships only that charger to Maps.

Constraint: Google Maps URLs cap waypoints (~9 on mobile). Long routes are sent
leg-by-leg — the app tracks overall progress, Maps handles the current leg.

### 3. Networks & filtering
- European CPOs: Ionity, Fastned, Tesla Supercharger, EnBW, Allego, Shell Recharge,
  TotalEnergies, Aral pulse, Vattenfall InCharge, Mer, EWE Go, GreenWay, Circle K, … —
  too many for inline chips, so networks get their own menu (toggle list) in the sidebar.
- Filters: network/company, minimum power, max price. Changing filters re-plans stops
  and the Charge-now ranking.
- Not filters, but principles: only chargers that are free right now are ever suggested
  (an occupied charger is not a result), and the planner is CCS-only — nobody plans a
  long-distance route around AC posts. Connector choice lives in the vehicle profile.

### 4. Pricing
- Per-station €/kWh, including the roaming reality: the same plug costs differently
  ad-hoc vs. via EnBW mobility+ vs. via Ionity Passport. The user registers their
  tariffs; the app compares and marks the cheapest.
- Data source candidates: Chargeprice API (built exactly for this), Eco-Movement,
  Open Charge Map (free, but prices are sparse). Decision pending API/pricing check.

### 5. Charge now
- One tap on the home screen: the three best chargers around the current position,
  ranked by price and constrained by the user's filters (networks, min power, max price,
  max distance). Each with a direct navigate-in-Google-Maps action. No route needed —
  for the "I just need a plug" case.
- If the filters starve the list (fewer than two hits), they are relaxed automatically
  in a fixed order until it recovers: min power → networks → max price → max distance.
  The sheet says which filters were relaxed. Availability is never relaxed.
- Pulling the sheet up expands it to full height; below the best three, the list
  continues by distance and scrolls endlessly (mockup shows the rest of the fake pool).

### 6. Recent routes and the active route
- Superseded 2026-09-28: saved routes are gone. Recents live in the search, and
  "An Maps senden" commits the plan as the active route, which has its own page
  behind the "Aktive Route" pill. See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-28-committed-trip.md`.

### 7. Live data
- Traffic per route leg (Routes API).
- Charger availability via OCPI status feeds from the data provider.
- Prices refreshed server-side; the app subscribes to changes (Flow).

## Later (explicitly not MVP)

Price alerts, charging history, Plug&Charge, a user-customizable priority order for the
Charge-now filter relaxing. CarPlay / Android Auto deliberately skipped — navigation
lives in Google Maps anyway.

## Architecture (the real build)

- **shared (Kotlin Multiplatform):** domain models, stop-planning algorithm, Ktor API
  clients, SQLDelight cache, coroutines/Flow for live data. All logic lives here.
- **androidApp:** Compose UI + Google Maps Compose SDK.
- **iosApp:** SwiftUI + Google Maps iOS SDK.
- **Backend:** thin proxy holding the API keys, aggregating charger/price data, caching
  aggressively (keys in a mobile binary are keys made public; also: rate limits).
- **Handoff:** platform deep links — `google.navigation:` on Android,
  `comgooglemaps://` on iOS, `https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&…` as universal
  fallback.

### Decided
- In-app map for planning, navigation delegated to Google Maps — chosen over a map-less
  list app (too abstract to trust a route) and a full in-app nav SDK (expensive, and
  duplicates what Maps already does better).
- Europe-wide market, € pricing.

### Open
- Price/availability data provider (Chargeprice vs. Eco-Movement) — needs an API access
  and pricing check before the backend design is finalized.
- Real product name.
- Backend hosting.

## UI direction

Light, "normal maps" look — Google-Maps-style colors (cream land, blue water, white
roads), white surfaces, Google blue for actions and the route line. No dark mode, no
neon. The home screen is the map itself: full-bleed, floating **Plan**, **Charge now**
and **❤️** pills at the bottom, a burger button top-left opening a sidebar where
preferences (vehicle, tariffs) and filters live; networks open as a submenu there.
Filters drive everything: the stop planner and the Charge-now ranking both re-plan when
they change. On a planned route, the send/select actions sit at the bottom of the
scrollable stop list, and stop cards stay minimal — name, price, arrival time, charge
duration; SoC, power, road position and the tariff comparison live one tap away in the
charger detail view. Car, Subscriptions and
Networks each open as their own full-screen, searchable view from the sidebar. The car
view manages a garage: add cars from a searchable catalog (specs seeded from the model),
and a delete mode that turns the selection ticks into ×. The sidebar has no Done
button — tapping next to it closes it, and closing applies the filters. Filter controls
are compact: power steps without comparison symbols, and vertical sliders side by side
for max price (ending at €1.00/kWh) and max distance. The Plan and Charge-now bottom
sheets can be pulled up to full height: expanded, Plan shows recent routes and Charge
now continues the charger list. Reference device: Pixel 10 Pro (punch-hole camera,
gesture bar) — not an iPhone.

## Mockup

`mockup/index.html` — a single self-contained file, phone frame, no dependencies, fake
data. Map-only home with floating pills and burger drawer → Charge now sheet (best 3 by
filters) → plan sheet → route overview (Amsterdam → München, traffic-colored SVG map,
all three Maps-handoff interactions working) → charger detail with tariff comparison.
Excluding Ionity in the drawer visibly re-plans both the route and the Charge-now list.
Built to be shown around, not to be kept.
