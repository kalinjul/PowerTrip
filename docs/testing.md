# Testing

How the project is tested, what each layer is for, and the commands. The
analysis that led here is at the bottom.

## Layers

| Layer | Where | Runs on | Answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | `shared/src/commonTest`, `shared/src/jvmTest` | JVM | Does the planning, formatting and ViewModel logic do the right thing? |
| Behaviour tests | `ui-tests/src/test` | JVM (Robolectric) | Do the phone screens show the right state and fire the right callbacks? |
| PhoneApp flow tests | `ui-tests/src/test/.../phoneapp` | JVM (Robolectric) | Does the whole phone app hold together: search → plan → sheet, X, back order, layout toggle, replan? |
| Screenshot tests | `ui-tests/src/screenshotTest` | JVM (Layoutlib) | Do the components still look like the approved picture? |
| iOS snapshot tests | `iosApp/PowerTripSnapshotTests` | iOS simulator, pinned | Do the iOS screens and markers still look like the approved picture? |
| iOS UI test | `iosApp/PowerTripUITests` | iOS simulator, with the backend | Does adding and picking a car work in the real app? |
| Device | by hand | phone / DHU / iOS simulator | Map, live data, Android Auto, feel |

Nothing in the test modules talks to a backend, the geocoder, Google Maps
or the network. Composables get fixed data from `Fixtures.kt`; the clock is
pinned through `LocalNow` so trip times don't drift.

## Modules

- `:phone-ui` — every phone composable and its resources. Library, so tests
  can depend on it.
- `:ui-tests` — depends on `:phone-ui`, holds both UI layers. Nothing here
  ships in the app.
- `:androidApp` — MainActivity (hosts `PhoneApp`), Android Auto, Koin wiring. Has
  no tests of its own.

## Commands

```bash
tools/check.sh                                     # the gates of the app you touched, as CI runs them
tools/check.sh sides                               # which app that is: android, ios, both or none
tools/check.sh android|ios|all [--record] [--no-goldens]

./gradlew testAll                                  # Android's tests, minus recording

./gradlew :shared:jvmTest                          # unit tests
./gradlew :ui-tests:testDebugUnitTest              # behaviour tests
tools/screenshots.sh validate                      # screenshots vs. goldens, in a container
tools/screenshots.sh update                        # re-record goldens, in a container
```

The two gradle screenshot tasks also run natively, but only the container
render counts: layoutlib anti-aliases differently on macOS and Linux, and
a golden recorded on a Mac fails on CI (and the other way round). The
script runs them on `linux/amd64` with the JDK CI uses, the host SDK
mounted read-only and its own Gradle home under `~/.powertrip-linux`.
The first run pulls everything and takes a few minutes; later ones are
quicker. It runs with `docker` or rootless `podman`, whichever is
installed (`POWERTRIP_CONTAINER_ENGINE` picks one when both are).

Goldens live in `ui-tests/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/`, one PNG per
`@PreviewTest` function. The validate task writes an HTML report with
reference, actual and diff to
`ui-tests/build/reports/screenshotTest/preview/debug/index.html`.

Tolerance is 0.1 % (`imageDifferenceThreshold` in `ui-tests/build.gradle.kts`).
A single recoloured 24dp badge in a sheet-sized image is about 0.3 %, so
anything looser lets colour changes of small elements through. Glyph and
vector anti-aliasing is only stable within one platform, which is why
goldens are rendered in the container and nowhere else. If a run ever fails
on noise alone, raise it in small steps and look at what it starts hiding.
When a golden changes on purpose, `tools/screenshots.sh update`, look at the
diff, commit the PNG.

## Only what changed

`tools/changed-sides.sh` sorts changed paths into the app they belong to:
`iosApp/`, `shared/src/iosMain` and the iOS tools wake iOS; `phone-ui/`,
`ui-tests/`, `androidApp/` and the JVM/Android source sets wake Android;
`shared/src/commonMain` (strings included), the build files and anything no
rule knows wake both; docs and `.claude/` wake nothing.
`tools/changed-sides.test.sh` pins the rules. `tools/check.sh` and CI's
first job both go through it; main always runs everything.

## iOS snapshots

`swift-snapshot-testing` (Point-Free, MIT), in a unit-test bundle hosted by
the app. Under a test host the app starts no Koin graph and no home screen,
so no backend is needed; tests feed `<Screen>Content` views from
`Fixtures.swift`. `assertLightAndDark(view, named:, frame:)` writes
`__Snapshots__/<Class>/<test>.<name>-light|dark.png`; `.phone` renders a
whole iPhone 17 Pro screen, `.fitting` the view at its own size. Both draw
in a real window, since off-screen rendering leaves iOS 26's glass controls
blank. German, like the Android goldens.

Rendering differs between Xcode and simulator versions the way layoutlib
differs between macOS and Linux, so both are pinned in
`tools/ios-toolchain.env` (Xcode 26.3, iOS 26.2, iPhone 17 Pro), and
`check.sh` refuses others. It runs on its own simulator, "PowerTrip
Checks", created on first use, so the one you work with is never touched.
Tolerance: 0.1 % of pixels may differ beyond a perceptual 2 %.

Recording, from the terminal; Xcode only has to be installed:

- On a Mac: `tools/check.sh ios --record`, look at the changed PNGs, commit
  them. The first time: `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS -buildVersion 26.2`.
- Without a Mac: push the branch, then *Actions → iOS goldens → Run
  workflow* on it. CI's Mac records, commits the goldens to the branch and
  starts CI on that commit.

When a test fails, the differing renders are in
`iosApp/build/check/snapshot-failures/`, on CI in the
`ios-snapshot-failures` artifact.

## Writing tests

- Behaviour: `@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner::class)`,
  `createAndroidComposeRule<ComponentActivity>()`, content wrapped in
  `PowerTripTheme`, strings via `compose.string(Res.string.x)` so the
  German copy is matched, not retyped (`robolectric.properties` pins
  `de-rDE`). Match by text or content
  description; a `testTag` is the last resort.
- Screenshot: a public top-level `@PreviewTest @Preview(showBackground = true)`
  composable in `ui-tests/src/screenshotTest`, wrapped in `PowerTripTheme`,
  fed from `Fixtures.kt`. Trip rows need
  `CompositionLocalProvider(LocalNow provides { LocalTime.of(14, 30) })`.
  Renaming a preview function orphans its golden; re-record.
- Dark theme: the app follows the system, so the components that carry
  colour have a `...Dark` twin with `uiMode = UI_MODE_NIGHT_YES`. The preview
  scaffold wraps content in a `Surface` like the app's sheets do, otherwise
  titles fall back to black on dark.
- Robolectric runs SDK 35 (`ui-tests/src/test/resources/robolectric.properties`)
  because it doesn't emulate 37 yet, and the test JVM opens a few `java.base`
  packages that Robolectric reflects into (`ui-tests/build.gradle.kts`).
- Locale: the same file sets `qualifiers=de-rDE`, and every `@Preview` carries
  `locale = "de"`, so comma decimals ("3,5 km") and 24h times ("16:08") are
  what the assertions and goldens see. A class that needs a bigger window
  writes `@Config(qualifiers = "+w600dp-h1000dp")` — without the `+` the
  locale is gone and the test runs in en-US.

## PhoneApp flow tests

`PhoneAppFlowTest` composes the real `PhoneApp` on the real Koin graph
(`chargeStopsModule`, `sharedUiModule`) with every world-facing data source replaced
in `PhoneAppHarness`: in-memory settings with a test vehicle, one fixed
location in Hamburg, a geocoder that knows München, a straight-line route
with three charge sites along it, empty live status and network
lists. Nothing reaches a server. Room runs for real on the bundled SQLite
driver.

Hand-offs to Google Maps are asserted on the `Intent` Robolectric records:
the whole trip, a picked section (first stop as waypoint, last as
destination) and a stop's "Navigation starten" `geo:` URI.

One wart: the Maps SDK's `CameraUpdateFactory` is only initialised by a
rendering map, which Robolectric has not. The harness installs a no-op
delegate through the SDK's obfuscated `CameraUpdateFactory.zza`. If a Maps
SDK update renames that, the PhoneApp flow tests fail at start-up with
"CameraUpdateFactory is not initialized" — fix the harness, not the app.

## Not covered, on purpose

- The Google Map and its markers on the map. Markers are tested as the
  bitmaps they're rendered from (`ChargerPill`, `ChargerDot`).
- Animations. Tests assert resting states before and after.
- End-to-end flows against the real backend, and Android Auto. Both stay on
  the device.

## Migration note

The screenshot plugin `com.android.compose.screenshot` is deprecated in
favour of AGP test suites, which arrive with AGP 9.5. Once 9.5 is stable:
drop the plugin, add `testOptions.screenshotTests.create("screenshotTest")`
with the engine version, keep the source set, goldens and tests as they are.

## Analysis (2026-09-22)

- DI: Koin (shared `sharedUiModule`, app `appModule`). Fine for tests, the
  UI layers don't need it: composables are stateless behind `*Route` wrappers.
- Unit framework: kotlin-test, `runBlocking`; coroutine ViewModel tests in
  `jvmTest` with `Dispatchers.setMain(Unconfined)`. 542 tests.
- Mocking: none, hand-written fakes. Kept that way.
- UI: 100 % Compose on the phone, Car App Library templates in the car.
- Before this setup: no behaviour tests, no screenshot tests, one `@Preview`.
  The regressions of the September UI rewrite (rail line missing, chip on the
  pill border, tiles laid out off-screen) were all visual or interaction
  bugs no unit test could see.
- Added: `:phone-ui` extraction, `:ui-tests` with Robolectric + Compose test
  APIs (JUnit4) and Compose Preview Screenshot Testing, jacoco on the test
  module, CI steps for both.
- Not added: Dropshots, UI Automator, Mockk — nothing asked for them.
