# CI and release pipeline

Two workflows, one fastlane configuration:

| What | Where | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build and test | [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | push to `main`, pull request against `main` |
| Re-record the iOS goldens on a branch | [`.github/workflows/ios-goldens.yml`](../.github/workflows/ios-goldens.yml) | by hand, *Run workflow* |
| Ship to the Play internal track | [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) | a GitHub release is published |
| What a release actually does | [`fastlane/Fastfile`](../fastlane/Fastfile) | called by the release workflow |

fastlane sits between the workflow and the build for one reason: the second
platform is already planned (ARCHITECTURE.md section 1.4, CarPlay). The
Fastfile has an `ios` platform block for TestFlight next to the `android`
one, and the GitHub job stays a thin wrapper that only hands over secrets.

## CI

A first job, **Which app changed**, sorts the pull request's files with
`tools/check.sh sides` and starts only the jobs of the app they belong to
(rules in docs/testing.md, "Only what changed"). A push to `main` runs
everything. A skipped job counts as passed for the required checks, so if
the sorting itself fails, every job runs.

Then, in parallel, matching what AGENTS.md demands before anything counts
as done:

- **Android build + shared tests** — `:androidApp:assembleDebug` and
  `:shared:jvmTest`. Test reports are uploaded on failure, the debug APK
  always, kept for one day.
- **Kotlin/Native (iosMain)** — `:shared:compileKotlinIosSimulatorArm64`.
  Compiles `iosMain` against the real cinterop bindings; linking is skipped
  on Linux, so no framework and no Objective-C header come out of it.
- **Swift syntax check** — `tools/check-swift.sh`. If the runner image has no
  `swiftc`, the job emits a warning annotation and passes: the check was
  never load-bearing, and a red build here would say nothing about the code.
- **iOS app + snapshot goldens** — on a `macos-26` runner, `tools/check.sh
  ios`: Kotlin/Native tests, the app and test bundles built, the snapshot
  goldens compared on the pinned Xcode and simulator. The XCUITest stays
  local; it needs the backend. Differing renders are uploaded on failure.
  macOS minutes are free on a public repository.

CI gets **one** secret: the Maven access to the contract module. `api-model`
comes from the PowerTrip backend's own repository, and without credentials
nothing resolves and nothing compiles. Consequence, and it is a real one:
**a pull request from a fork cannot be built here.** A preflight step in both
Gradle jobs says so outright instead of letting the run die on a 401.

No backend or map keys: the build does not need them, only a running app
does.

Not part of CI (deliberately): the live contract tests against the backend.
They only run with `POWERTRIP_LIVE=1` — a build that goes red because a
server hiccups says nothing about this repository.

## Releasing

1. Bump nothing by hand. `versionName` comes from the tag, `versionCode`
   from Play (see below).
2. Cut a GitHub release on a tag such as `v0.3.0`.
3. The workflow builds the signed AAB and uploads it to the **internal test
   track**, release status `completed` — testers on the internal list get it
   within minutes.

A prerelease ships too. If that is not wanted, the job needs
`if: ${{ !github.event.release.prerelease }}`.

To repeat a failed upload, use **Run workflow** on the Release workflow and
give it the tag. Rebuilding the same tag is safe.

### Where the version numbers come from

`versionName` is the tag without a leading `v`.

`versionCode` is asked of Play: fastlane reads the highest code across
`internal`, `alpha`, `beta` and `production` and adds one. Deriving it
locally would be more fragile — a run number restarts at 1 after a
repository move, and a re-cut tag would produce the same number twice, which
Play refuses.

Consequence: **the very first bundle has to be uploaded through the Play
Console by hand.** The API cannot create the app entry, and until a bundle
exists there is no code to increment. The lane says so instead of failing
obscurely.

A local build without `VERSION_CODE` in the environment keeps the
checked-in fallback (`androidApp/build.gradle.kts`), so nothing about
`assembleDebug` changes.

## Secrets

All of these are repository secrets (*Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions*), except the one variable noted as such.

| Secret | Read by | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CHARGEAHEAD_MAVEN_USER` | both | user of the backend's Maven repository |
| `CHARGEAHEAD_MAVEN_PASSWORD` | both | its password, from `/root/chargeahead/maven-password.txt` on the host |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | release | the upload keystore, base64-encoded |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | release | keystore password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | release | alias of the key inside the keystore |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | release | password of that key |
| `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | release | the service account JSON, whole file |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | release | Maps SDK key, goes into the manifest |
| `CHARGEAHEAD_TOKEN` | release | API token, from `/root/chargeahead/api-token.txt` on the host |

One **variable** (same page, *Variables* tab) rather than a secret, because a
URL is not one:

| Variable | Read by | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CHARGEAHEAD_BASE_URL` | release | `https://api.chargeahead.julakali.org` |

### The app token is extractable

`CHARGEAHEAD_TOKEN` ends up in `BuildConfig` and therefore in the APK. Anyone
who unpacks a release can read it. That is accepted for now — the backend's
daily quota per token is what limits what a leaked one can cost, and rotating
it means regenerating it on the host and shipping a new build. Real per-user
authentication (OIDC) is the way out, and is not built yet.

### Keystore

Create it once and keep it — Play ties the app to this key, and a lost
upload key means asking Google to reset it:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore upload.keystore -alias upload \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Encode it for the secret (`-w0`, otherwise the line breaks end up in the
secret and `base64 --decode` produces garbage):

```bash
base64 -w0 upload.keystore
```

The workflow decodes it into `$RUNNER_TEMP`, never into the workspace, and
deletes it again in an `always()` step. `*.keystore` and `*.jks` are in
`.gitignore`, but the safe place for the file is outside the working tree
entirely.

### Play service account

1. Play Console → *Setup → API access* → link a Google Cloud project.
2. Create a service account there, grant it the **Release manager** role (or
   at minimum: release to testing tracks) for this app.
3. Create a JSON key for it, and paste the entire file into
   `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.

Permissions in the Play Console take a while to propagate; a fresh account
can answer with 403 for an hour or so.

### A local build signs nothing

Without a keystore no `signingConfig` is created at all, and
`:androidApp:bundleRelease` produces an unsigned artifact rather than
failing. To sign locally, put these into `local.properties` (they take
precedence over the environment):

```properties
releaseKeystoreFile=/absolute/path/upload.keystore
releaseKeystorePassword=...
releaseKeyAlias=upload
releaseKeyPassword=...
```

## iOS: what is prepared and what is not

`fastlane/Fastfile` has an `ios` platform with a `beta` lane (XcodeGen →
`build_app` → TestFlight). **It has never run.** It was written on Linux
without a Mac, without Xcode and without an App Store Connect account —
treat it as an ordered list of the required steps, not as a working lane.
No workflow calls it.

Before the first run, three things need deciding:

1. Apple's approval for `com.apple.developer.carplay-charging`. Without it,
   signing fails regardless of what is configured (ARCHITECTURE.md 1.4).
2. Signing: App Store Connect API key with automatic signing, or fastlane
   `match` with a certificates repository. `match` is the better fit as soon
   as a second machine signs.
3. Where the build number comes from — `iosApp/PowerTrip/Info.plist` is
   hand-maintained, and `project.yml` deliberately does not regenerate it.

The job for it belongs on `macos-latest` with `brew install xcodegen`, in
the same release workflow next to `play-internal`.

## Ruby

`Gemfile` pins fastlane by major version. There is no `Gemfile.lock` in the
repository (no Ruby on the development machine to generate one); CI resolves
on every run. Generating one on a machine with Ruby and committing it makes
release builds reproducible and is worth doing:

```bash
bundle lock
```
