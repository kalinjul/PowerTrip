# ChargeAhead — Roadmap

What is built, what comes next, and which questions are still open.
Design and platform constraints live in **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**;
this file only says *what* gets built in which order, and *why not yet*.

As of: 2026-09-14

## 1. Milestones

| M | Content | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** ✅ | Walking skeleton: Gradle/KMP scaffold, `CarAppService` with a static screen, CarPlay scene, manifest/entitlements | Android built, installed, POI service registered on the device. iOS code written, not compiled. |
| **M1** ✅ | Location, corridor, OCM connection, list sorted by distance, live updates | Android built, 109 tests green, all three iOS targets compile, Swift parses. OCM mapping verified against the real service (123 sites). Only what needs the Objective-C header or a device stays unverified. |
| **M2** ✅ | Vehicle profile, manual SoC, range, reachability rating, `CarHardwareSoCSource` | Android built and run through on the emulator: profile entered, connector filter works, arrival SoC shown. `CarHardwareSoCSource` is written but **never run with a vehicle** — that needs a head unit that actually supplies the data. |
| **M3** ✅ | BNetzA source, dedup/merge, offline tile cache | Both sources run merged, the local store survives process end (verified on-device in airplane mode). At the same location, the nearest charging stop moved from 16 km to 2.4 km, because the registry knows charging parks that OpenChargeMap is missing. |
| **M4** | Network filter, detail view, navigation hand-off, consumption learning | ready for everyday use. **Detail view, navigation hand-off, and network filter are in place and verified in the car**; consumption learning is still missing — it requires reliable SoC measurements and has no data basis with manual entry. |
| **M6** | Vehicle list as a preset, elevation profile and wind in the consumption model | estimate becomes robust instead of rough |
| **M5** | GoingElectric, Mobilithek. The own routing backend is in place. | more sources |

**To be started in parallel and immediately, because externally
blocked:** apply for the CarPlay entitlement with Apple · register the OCM
API key · request the BNetzA interface description by email.

## 2. The phone UI

Two decisions taken on 2026-09-05; **built on 2026-09-07** along the design
mockup in `docs/mockup/index.html` (design doc:
`docs/2026-09-07-phone-ui-design.md`). The map itself is still a placeholder
drawing — the map-SDK decision below remains open, everything else works:
map-first home, an always-present search bar that plans on a pick (since
2026-09-21; the trip itself is a sheet over the map) with charging stops from
the shared `TripPlanner`, "Jetzt laden" (best chargers nearby with an auto-relax filter
ladder), garage with vehicle presets and consumption slider, the active
route (the trip last sent to Maps, kept until ended), and Google-Maps hand-off for the whole route, a section, or a single stop.
iOS has the core screens (home, plan, charge now, trip, stop detail); the
garage view is still Android-only.

**The start screen becomes a map view.** Today the phone shows the same
plain list as the car (`ChargeStopsPhoneScreen` in
`androidApp/.../phone/MainActivity.kt`) — it exists mostly to check that
location, API key, and the shared state actually work. That's the wrong
shape for the phone: on a map, corridor, route, and the charging stops
along it are grasped at a glance, and the phone is exactly the surface
where that's allowed. In the car it stays a list — see the design rule in
ARCHITECTURE.md §7: no information that needs two glances.

**Destination planning moves into a bottom sheet.** Today
`DestinationScreen` replaces the whole content, so the context is gone
while a destination is being entered. As a bottom sheet over the map, the
search sits above the map instead of replacing it: type, see the hits,
watch the route and its charging stops appear underneath.

Still open:

- **Which map — decided 2026-09-07: Google Maps Compose on Android.** The
  key exists (`googleMapsApiKey` in `local.properties` → manifest
  placeholder), and navigation hands off to Google Maps anyway. Without a
  key the app says so in place of the map instead of showing Google's
  blank grey. iOS still draws the
  placeholder; the Maps iOS SDK needs SPM wiring and a key in
  `Secrets.xcconfig`, and is the next iOS step.
- **What the map shows.** Charging stops as markers is obvious. Whether
  the corridor sector, the route line, and the reachability colors
  belong on it is not.
- **Price data.** The app shows no prices at all. It used to compare
  tariffs per site against a built-in demo table, every quote labeled an
  estimate — removed on 2026-09-10, because an estimate that precise reads
  as a fact, and in an app for the car that is the same class of mistake as
  passing off demo charging stations as real. Prices come back when a real
  source does: Chargeprice vs. Eco-Movement is the same kind of decision as
  OCM was — keyed API, contract test, replaceable data source.
  The subscriptions screen and the `TariffSource` data source go with it; they
  existed only to feed the comparison.
- **Charge-now availability.** "Only free right now" is deliberately not a
  filter yet: no connected source has live occupancy. The relax ladder's
  order (power → networks → distance) should later become
  user-configurable.

## 3. Open points

1. **Android Auto only verifiable on real hardware** — the projected UI
   doesn't run on any emulator: the preinstalled Android Auto there is a
   stub, and the Play Store reports "not compatible" for emulator
   hardware. With a real phone connected to the Desktop Head Unit, though,
   it's fully verifiable, and the DHU can be remote-controlled through its
   standard input while doing so (see docs/android-auto-testen.md).

   **Run through in the car for the first time on 2026-09-04** (Pixel 10
   Pro, Android Auto 17.4, DHU 2.0): list, detail view, and the hand-off to
   navigation work. Google Maps opened with a route to the selected
   charging station.
2. **CarPlay simulator without an entitlement** — whether the Xcode CarPlay
   simulator launches with a key entered locally into `.entitlements` but
   not approved by Apple is documented inconsistently. Needs practical
   verification once a Mac with Xcode is available. Affects the M0 schedule
   on the iOS side.
3. **Consumption model** — **speed is in** (2026-09-14). `Route` carries a
   speed profile (`segments`, per-stretch distance and time), the backend
   supplies it from the routing provider's own steps, and
   `RoadLoadConsumption` prices each stretch from the car's road-load curve
   (backend catalog, or a generic one) at the speed it implies. The
   charging curve went the same way: `GenericChargeCurve` replaced the flat
   `AVERAGE_CURVE_FACTOR = 0.65`, and charge time is integrated over the SoC
   band. Both are described in ARCHITECTURE.md §5.1.

   The blocker named below is therefore gone: `ConsumptionModel` knows the
   route. What is still open, in order of expected benefit:

   - **Elevation profile.** Done: the backend sends ascent and descent per
     route segment, `RoadLoadConsumption` prices climbing and recuperation,
     and the planner keeps the reserve at each summit (ARCHITECTURE.md §5.1).
   - **Headwind.** At highway speed, drag is by far the largest factor;
     30 km/h of headwind acts like driving noticeably faster. Needs a
     weather source and the direction of travel — the latter is already
     available via the heading from the corridor.
   - **Decay of the typed-in charge level.** A manually set value ages with
     every kilometer driven. Aging it forward over the distance driven
     would be the same calculation that already produces the arrival SoC —
     until then, the UI has to make visible how old the value is.
   - **Temperature.** Consumption is in: the backend sends the DWD forecast
     per route segment, and `RoadLoadConsumption` prices heating, denser air
     and a cold drivetrain (ARCHITECTURE.md §5.1). Still open: a cold pack
     also slows the charging curve, and the coefficients want checking
     against measured winter consumption.
   - From M4, the rolling average from actual SoC drop over distance.

   Temperature and wind land on `ConsumptionModel`; neither needs another
   structural change.

   Since #72 the planner is no longer greedy: stops are an exact shortest
   path priced in minutes, so there is no 80 % target left to tune. What is
   left to calibrate are the prices in `TripPlanner` — stop overhead, the
   network and weak-charger penalties, the detour speed.

4. **Vehicle list.** Deliberately not built in M2: the driver enters usable
   capacity and consumption themselves. That's honest — the numbers are in
   the spec sheet — but inconvenient, because few people know their *usable*
   capacity. The garage now offers presets, still overridable, from the
   backend's vehicle catalog (`GET /v1/vehicles`, cached in Room). It is
   maintained in the backend admin area, so a correction or a new model
   needs no app release. The price is still maintenance: a wrong preset
   value is worse than none, because nobody checks it.
5. **Server: in place.** Routes, destination search, charge sites, live
   status and the vehicle catalog all come from the ChargeAhead backend. The
   app carries no routing engine of its own and talks to no third-party
   service for any of them; the provider keys live in the backend.

   **The app no longer runs against `router.project-osrm.org`.** Which
   router answers is the backend's configuration: OSRM, a self-hosted
   GraphHopper, or Google Routes. The backend's default is still the OSRM
   project's public demo server, which is explicitly not meant for
   production use and comes with no guarantee. The app can't plan against
   it anyway: OSRM carries no elevation, and the app rejects a route segment
   without ascent and descent. **A deployed backend must run GraphHopper or
   Google before any release** — that is a backend setting, nothing in the
   app changes with it.

6. **Destination search via the backend.** The app asks the ChargeAhead
   backend (`GET /v1/places`) and no geocoder directly; the `Geocoder`
   interface has that one implementation. Behind it the backend runs Photon,
   with no alternative provider.

   The backend's default is komoot's public Photon instance, which is fair
   use and not meant for operation. **A deployed backend needs its own
   Photon instance before any release** — a backend setting, like the router
   in item 5. Photon needs several GB of memory and a search index in the
   tens of GB, so it's a hosting question rather than a code change.

   OpenStreetMap's data (ODbL) must be credited — the same applies to
   routes computed on it.

7. **Charging-network operator logos.** Making Ionity, EnBW, Aral pulse and
   the rest recognizable by their mark would be a real win in the car: a
   logo is grasped at a glance, a company name isn't. Three things need
   clarifying first, and none of them is technical:

   - **Trademark law.** Operator logos are protected. Shipping them needs
     permission or at least a solid assessment; that's not a question the
     code can decide.
   - **Mapping.** The sources spell the same operator differently: "IONITY
     GmbH", "Ionity", "E.ON Drive GmbH" and "E.ON Drive Infrastructure
     GmbH", "EnBW (D)", "Mer Germany GmbH". It needs a normalization table —
     with the same maintenance problem as the vehicle list, and a
     mis-mapped logo is worse than none.
   - **Delivery.** Android Auto doesn't load arbitrary image URLs; the marks
     would have to ship as vector resources in the app. That caps the count
     and turns every addition into an app update.

8. **Buffer is straight-line, not detour.** A charging station 1 km off the
   highway can cost a 12 km detour via the next-but-one exit, possibly on
   the wrong side. Real detour costs would need a second route computation
   per candidate. The buffer is the workable approximation; whether it's
   good enough is for practice to decide.
9. **Play Store approval** — POI apps go through a separate review against
   the Car App Quality Guidelines. Plan for this before M4.
10. **From plans to committed trips** — the app watches a committed trip
    and re-plans charging when the charge or the position drifts, handing
    the result to Maps; saved routes were dropped for it on 2026-09-28.
    See `docs/2026-09-22-committed-trip-roadmap.md`.
