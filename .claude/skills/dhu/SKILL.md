name: dhu
description: Starts, connects to and remote-controls the Android Auto Desktop Head Unit (DHU) to check this app's car surface — list, detail view, navigation hand-off, destination entry in the car. Always use this skill when the DHU, the Desktop Head Unit, Android Auto, the car UI, the CarAppService, a head unit, or starting/viewing/operating the app "in the car" comes up — even if the DHU isn't named explicitly. Same for "Failed to read from transport", when the car UI stays empty, or when checking whether a change reaches the car.

# Checking the app in the car

The car UI is this app's actual purpose, and it's the one surface that
**cannot** be checked in an emulator: the preinstalled Android Auto there is
a stub, and the Play Store reports emulator hardware as "not compatible". It
needs a real phone connected to the Desktop Head Unit.

All the fiddly parts are wrapped in `scripts/dhu.sh`. Use the script instead
of starting the DHU by hand — manual starts fail on two quirks explained
below.

## Flow

```bash
D=.claude/skills/dhu/scripts/dhu.sh

$D doctor                       # SDK, DHU, adb, phone, head unit server: what is missing, and the fix
$D status                       # already running? phone attached?
$D start                        # over USB — run in the background, see below
$D send "keycode home"          # to the app launcher
$D shot /tmp/car.png            # see where you are
$D tap 633 228                  # tap what you saw
$D stop
```

**Always run `$D start` as a background command** (Bash tool with
`run_in_background: true`), and on its own — never chained with `&&`/`;`
or piped into `tail`. The DHU and its FIFO writer keep running detached,
and a foreground call never returns. Then wait until `$D status` reports
`DHU: running` (the start takes about 12 s) and carry on with `send`,
`tap` and `shot` as normal foreground calls:

```bash
# Bash tool, run_in_background: true
.claude/skills/dhu/scripts/dhu.sh start
```

```bash
# Bash tool, foreground: wait until it is up
D=.claude/skills/dhu/scripts/dhu.sh
for i in $(seq 1 20); do $D status | grep -q "DHU: running" && break; sleep 3; done
$D status
```

The background task's output file shows whether the connection came up
(`DHU connected …`) or why it didn't.

Take a `shot` after every `tap` and **actually look at the image**.
Positions in the app launcher depend on how many apps are installed and which
page you're on — guessed coordinates reliably hit the wrong thing.

## Linux and macOS

The script finds the SDK on its own: `ANDROID_HOME`, `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`,
`~/Library/Android/sdk` (macOS), `~/Android/Sdk` (Linux), or the `sdk.dir`
in `local.properties`. It uses the SDK's own `adb`, so nothing has to be on
PATH, and it needs neither `setsid` nor `stdbuf`: on macOS it detaches with
`nohup` and gets unbuffered output through BSD `script`. `/bin/bash` 3.2 is
enough. Override with `DHU_BIN`, `ADB` or `ANDROID_HOME` only if `doctor`
says it looked in the wrong place.

The DHU itself comes from Android Studio → SDK Manager → SDK Tools →
"Android Auto Desktop Head Unit emulator"; `doctor` tells you when it is
missing.

## A virtual Pixel instead of a phone

Google documents the DHU only against a physical phone, but what it needs
is a real Android Auto with its head unit server on the other end of adb,
and an emulator is on adb too. The catch: the Play images ship a
placeholder (`versionName` ends in `-stub`), with no launcher and no
server. `$D doctor` says so and names the device. To get a working virtual
Pixel:

1. Start a `google_apis_playstore` AVD (here `Pixel_10a`), sign in to the
   Play Store on it, and install Android Auto. If Play calls it "not
   compatible with your device", install the APK bundle by hand:
   `adb -s emulator-5554 install-multiple base.apk split_*.apk` with the
   files for the emulator's ABI (arm64-v8a on Apple silicon).
2. In Android Auto on the emulator: Settings → version ten times →
   three-dot menu → "Allow unknown sources" and "Start head unit server".
3. `ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 $D doctor` until every line is `ok`, then
   `ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 $D start --adb` (always `--adb`; there is
   no USB accessory on an emulator).

Everything after that is the same as with a phone, including the server
stopping on every disconnect. Location in the emulator comes from
`app.sh where`, which the car app then sees through Play services.

## Before the first attempt

The app must be installed on the **phone**, not the emulator:

```bash
ANDROID_SERIAL=<serial> ./gradlew :androidApp:installDebug
```

One-time setup in Android Auto on the phone: Settings → scroll to the bottom
→ tap the version number ten times → in the three-dot menu, **"Allow
unknown sources"**. Without this the debug app never shows up in the
launcher.

## Two ways to reach the phone

**USB (`$D start`)** is the default and needs nothing but the cable.

**ADB (`$D start --adb`)** additionally needs the head unit server, started
from the same developer menu. It stops when the connection drops and when
the phone sleeps, and has to be started again then; an app reinstall
leaves it running. The script checks this beforehand and says so, instead of failing
with a confusing abort. On macOS this is the mode that works reliably; USB
accessory mode depends on the cable and the Mac's USB stack. A phone on
wireless debugging shows up on adb like a cabled one, with a serial like
`adb-XXXX._adb-tls-connect._tcp`, and `--adb` works over it.

With **several phones attached**, the DHU connects to whichever answers
first — possibly not the one you mean. The script refuses to start then;
pick one with `ANDROID_SERIAL=<serial> $D start`.

## Screen layouts

The default is a small 800×480 screen, where apps always run full screen.
Real cars with a wide display show a **split screen**: the app on one side,
Maps in a narrow panel beside it. To check anything about that layout, start
with a config from the DHU's `config/` folder:

```bash
# Bash tool, run_in_background: true
.claude/skills/dhu/scripts/dhu.sh start --config default_wide   # 1280×720, split screen
```

Other configs: `default_720p`, `default_1080p`, or a path to your own
`.ini`. Screenshots and `tap` coordinates then use that resolution
(1280×720 for `default_wide`, with the usable area between the dashed lines).

## DHU console commands

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `keycode home` | go to the app launcher |
| `tap <x> <y>` | tap, (0,0) top left, resolution matches the screenshot (800×480 unless started with `--config`) |
| `screenshot <file>` | take a screenshot — `$D shot` does exactly that |
| `location <lat> <lon> [accuracy] [altitude] [speed] [bearing]` | fake a location |
| `compass <bearing>` | set the heading |
| `dpad up/down/left/right/click/back` | for rotary-controller input |
| `night` / `day` | day/night rendering |
| `help` | full list |

`location` and `compass` go to the *car*, not the phone. This app reads its
location through the phone's Play services and sees none of this — a
different location needs a mock-location app on the phone.

## Four traps that cost time

**`adb forward` proves nothing.** It accepts the connection *on the
computer* and only forwards it afterward. If nothing is listening on the
other end, it's closed immediately — locally that looks like a port that's
answering, and the DHU just reports `Failed to read from transport -
disconnect`. That looks like a DHU bug and isn't one. What actually matters
is `adb shell netstat -lnt | grep 5277`.

**The DHU dies on closed input.** It reads commands from stdin and exits
silently on EOF — i.e. on every start from a script. Hence the FIFO with a
permanent writer in the script.

**Output is block-buffered.** Without `stdbuf -o0`, responses only appear
after kilobytes of output. Without the script you wouldn't even see what's
going wrong.

**`pkill -f desktop-head-unit` catches its own shell**, because its command
line contains the pattern. Kill by PID instead — or use `$D stop`.

## When the list stays empty in the car

Check the app's log first, don't guess:

```bash
adb -s <serial> logcat -d | grep "W PowerTrip "
```

The app deliberately catches errors so it keeps running, but logs them with
a cause. Most common finding: `UnknownHostException`. On Android derivatives
like GrapheneOS, `android.permission.INTERNET` is a revocable permission and
is off for freshly installed apps:

```bash
adb -s <serial> shell pm grant org.julakali.chargeahead android.permission.INTERNET
```

If the UI shows the permission screen instead, the location is missing — in
projection mode the head unit can't show the system dialog itself, it
appears on the phone.
