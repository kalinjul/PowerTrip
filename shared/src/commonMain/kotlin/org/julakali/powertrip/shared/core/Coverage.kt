/**
 * Which part of the map a fetch actually answered for.
 *
 * Sources return the shape they were asked for, not its bounding box, so:
 *
 * - A fetch records only the tiles its shape **fully contains** ([tilesToRecord]).
 * - A query needs every tile its shape **touches** ([isCovered]).
 * - A route buffer is too narrow to contain a whole tile, so routes are
 *   additionally recorded as corridors, and a route query is checked piece by
 *   piece against those — or against fresh tiles, whichever covers the piece.
